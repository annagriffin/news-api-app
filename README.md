The articles are displayed in a list along with summarizing details about each. This app was created with [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) framework. 

## Estimated Reading Time
The reading time that accompanies each article listing is roughly estimated based on the number of characters that are in the article. Estimated reading time is based on character count which is provided by the API.
